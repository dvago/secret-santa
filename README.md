# Secret Santa Party

A small app to run for my upcoming xmas party, given the list of friends via Firebase DB

The user is able to login and randomly get his secret santa name

The Firebase data is stored in a config file excluded from the repo (you know... security)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
